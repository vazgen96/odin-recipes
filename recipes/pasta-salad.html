    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For anyone who likes Buffalo wings, this is a great change of pace from normal pasta salad. Really popular as a side dish for a barbeque or just about any gathering you can think of. You can substitute or add many different vegetables with this recipe.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta</li>  
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>  
        <li>½ cup buffalo wing sauce</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
        <li>Stir together the mayonnaise, blue cheese dressing, buffalo wing sauce, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken, bell peppers, red onion, and cooked pasta and toss to coat with the dressing. Cover and chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.</li>
    </ol>
