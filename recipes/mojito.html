    <h1>The Real Mojito</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>  
        <li>Â½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>  
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
        <li>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>    
    </ol>
